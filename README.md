# SQLanalysis

Using SQL we analysed the imdb database. We asked questions on the movies made by Woody Allen. For example, we wondered which actor appeared the most often in his movies. Check the files to find out the answer! For each query we presented the result, added an interpretation/ explanation and a result.

We used MySQL via phpMyAdmin for this project, as well as python and jupiter notebooks.
